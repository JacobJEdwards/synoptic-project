# Client Side View

- Made a custom SPA
- Probably should've used React
- May convert to tyepscript as javascripts loose typing and lack of contracts (i.e. interfaces and abstract methods) makes it really a lot on trust implementations
- root is responsable for routing

## TODO

- css
- login (currently anyone can add recipes)
